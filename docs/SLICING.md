# Slicing

> [!WARNING]
> Slicer profiles intended for the AD5M with stock Flashforge software do not work out of the box with this mod. Make sure to update the printer profile as described below.

## Printer profile

Existing AD5M profiles can be used a baseline. But make sure to configure at least the following settings in the printer profile:

* GCODE output style should be _klipper_
* Do _*not*_ use the default FlashForge OrcaSlicer settings, they do not contain proper start/end sequences. 
* Edit the printer profile to use the [START_PRINT](../printer_configs/macros.cfg#L16) and [END_PRINT](../printer_configs/macros.cfg#L56) as described in macros.cfg as start/end macros.
* No further command from the old configuration should be present. Please, take care that this will make your sliced GCODE no longer suitable for the stock firmware.

> **Example:**  
> `START_PRINT BED_TEMP={first_layer_bed_temperature[0]} EXTRUDER_TEMP={first_layer_temperature[0]}`

Variables may differ depending on the slicer used.

### Timelapse Support

To support automatic timelapse creation via Moonraker-timelapse add `TIMELAPSE_TAKE_FRAME` to the before layer change G-code in the printer profile. Refer to the [Moonraker-timelapse](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/moonraker-timelapse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) documentation for more details.

## Automatic Bed Leveling and Nozzle Priming

The `START_PRINT` macro will do automatically bed leveling if no bed mesh profile is loaded. If you want to level the bed before each print you can set the `FORCE_LEVEL=true` parameter.

Alternatively, save a `default` profile that is loaded on Klipper Start or manually trigger bed leveling via the provided `AUTOMATIC_BED_LEVEL` macro.

The `START_PRINT` macro will automatically print a purge line before print. This can be disabled by setting the `DISABLE_PRIMING=true` parameter.

## Configuring Moonraker / Klipper connection

To connect to the printer, use the following physical printer settings:
* Host type: `moonraker`, `klipper` or `klipper (via moonraker)`
* Hostname, IP or URL: `x.y.z.a:7125` (replace with your ip)
